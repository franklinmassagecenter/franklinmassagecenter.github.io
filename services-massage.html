              This type of treatment can encompass many different modalities
              such as Trigger Point or Neuromuscular Therapy, Myofascial
              Release, and stretching with the goal of alleviating specific
              pain, discomfort, or stiffness in the muscles and fascia. While
              the pressure is firmer and deeper, it is always kept within the
              client's manageable limits through thorough communication. Clients
              can expect to feel the therapist using her thumbs, knuckles,
              forearms, and elbows in order to address the unique therapeutic
              needs in each individual session.

            <h2>Cupping Therapy</h2>
            <p>
              As seen on famous Olympic swimmer, Michael Phelps, Cupping Therapy
              combines ancient methods from Traditional Chinese Medicine with
              the innovative approaches of western science. The therapist uses
              plastic cups and an air piston to create “negative pressure,” or
              suction, to bring pain relief and greater range of motion. Cups
              are used to break up adhesions in and to lift the layers of
              tissue, which stimulates the body's natural healing systems and
              helps rehydrate congested areas. Cupping can be incorporated into`
              a 60 or 90 minute massage session. Please note: cupping can leave
              dark circular marks on the skin that typically last for five to
              seven days.

              Targeting the Lymphatic System—which supports our body's immune

              specific sequence to encourage better function in filtering

              the body by the contractions of the heart, the lymph fluid does
              not have a pump, and thus flows more easily when stimulated by
              body movement and LDM. Clients who are recovering from surgery, or
              suffer with allergies, edema (swelling), and auto-immune diseases

            <h2>Neuromuscular Therapy</h2>
            <p>
              Neuromuscular therapy is a specialized form of deep tissue work that treats a specific manifestation of
              muscular dysfunction,
              known as trigger points with manual pressure, followed by lengthening. It is designed to return the body
              to
              a
              state of ease and balance by eliminating the uneven pulls of the skeleton caused by contracted muscles and
              constricted fascia. NMT aids in the functional ability of the body by reducing self-perpetuating stress
              factors, such as contractions, spasms and tensions in the soft tissue components of the body.
            </p>
            <p>
              The therapist uses slow pressure with thumbs, elbows or a tool to apply pressure along the length of a
              muscle. This recalibrates the nerve receptors that determine muscle length, allowing contracted muscles to
              relax. When receiving this work, you should feel a sort of "sweet pain" that reaches other areas of the
              body
              in which that particular trigger point affects. Eventually the "sweet pain" diminishes which means the
              muscle is on its way to lengthening and relaxing.

              Myofascial release focuses on releasing the fascia that holds the muscle. Fascia is known to create

              and creams. This allows the therapist to accurately detect fascial restrictions and apply the appropriate

            <h2>Scrape & Tape</h2>
            <p>
              Great for pre-event prep or post-event soreness, these sessions focus on one or two areas of importance.
              Graston is used to help open up the fascial and muscle layers to promote circulation before applying
              KT Tape. KT Tape pre-event helps to promote activation and mobility. KT Tape post-event helps to promote
              decompression of inflamed areas for recovery.
