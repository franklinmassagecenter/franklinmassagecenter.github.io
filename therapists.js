      'Nicole graduated from The Cumberland Institute in Brentwood, Tennessee and has been practicing Massage Therapy for over 14 years. She is proficient in Deep Tissue, Swedish, Acupressure, and Lymphatic Drainage Massage (LDM). Known as the "Glute Queen," Nicole is known for her exceptional work on the gluteal muscle group. She has found that this important area of the body that connects our upper to our lower is sadly often the most neglected by many Massage Therapists. Her technique combining Trigger Point Therapy and breath work allows the release of these muscles that often contribute to low back and hip pain.',

She combines her unique skillset in order to address each of her client's needs, tailoring each session to the individual. Nicole equally enjoys offering the Lymphatic Drainage Massage modality for clients who may suffer with allergies, edema (swelling), and auto-immune diseases.
