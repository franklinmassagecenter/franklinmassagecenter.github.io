She is proficient in Deep Tissue, Swedish, Acupressure, and Lymphatic Drainage Massage (LDM). Known as the "Glute Queen," Nicole is known for her exceptional work on the gluteal muscle group.

Her technique combining Trigger Point Therapy and breath work allows the release of these muscles that often contribute to low back and hip pain.',

She combines her unique skillset in order to address each of her client's needs, tailoring each session to the individual.
