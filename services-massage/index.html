            <h2>Deep Tissue</h2>
            <p>
              This type of treatment can encompass many different modalities
              such as Trigger Point or Neuromuscular Therapy, Myofascial
              Release, and stretching with the goal of alleviating specific
              pain, discomfort, or stiffness in the muscles and fascia. While
              the pressure is firmer and deeper, it is always kept within the
              client’s manageable limits through thorough communication. Clients
              can expect to feel the therapist using her thumbs, knuckles,
              forearms, and elbows in order to address the unique therapeutic
              needs in each individual session.

            <h2>Sports</h2>
            <p>
              This form of massage is simply geared toward treating active
              individuals, using selected modalities, techniques and advanced
              knowledge of anatomical function in order to tailor the session to
              their specific conditions and goals. Sports Massage aids in pain
              reduction and tension relief from intense activity and can shorten
              recovery time and enhance performance.

            <p>
              A traditional form of massage, this modality uses moderate
              pressure with long, fluid strokes to encourage therapeutic
              relaxation. By stimulating the calming and soothing mechanisms of
              the nervous system, Swedish Massage promotes a restorative state
              in which the body may truly repair and heal from the effects of
              anxiety, stress, and even depression.

            <h2>Cupping Therapy</h2>
            <p>
              As seen on famous Olympic swimmer, Michael Phelps, Cupping Therapy
              combines ancient methods from Traditional Chinese Medicine with
              the innovative approaches of western science. The therapist uses
              plastic cups and an air piston to create “negative pressure,” or
              suction, to bring pain relief and greater range of motion. Cups
              are used to break up adhesions in and to lift the layers of
              tissue, which stimulates the body’s natural healing systems and
              helps rehydrate congested areas. Cupping can be incorporated into
              a 60 or 90 minute massage session. Please note: cupping can leave
              dark circular marks on the skin that typically last for five to
              seven days.

            <h2>Ashiatsu</h2>
            <p>
              This barefoot massage allows the therapist to access her full body
              weight in order to provide a deep, full body therapy using the
              feet to give broad consistent pressure. In Japanese, “ashi” means
              foot and “atsu” means pressure. Combining elements of Traditional
              Chinese Medicine, Myofascial Release, and trigger point work, this
              form of bodywork can address the needs of many different bodies in
              a uniquely distinctive way.

            <h2>Graston Technique</h2>
            <p>
              This is a modern western modality focused on breaking up adhesions
              and initiating the body’s inflammation process in order to invite
              the body’s natural healing response. While not directly connected,
              this technique is very similar to the ancient Traditional Chinese
              Medicine practice known as “Gua Sha” which draws toxins and excess
              heat to be released at the surface of the body. Graston Technique
              incorporates the use of instrument-assisted soft tissue
              mobilization to speed up recovery after injury.
            </p>
            <p>
              *Graston Technique can be done alone in a 30 minute session or

            <h2>Lymphatic Drainage Massage (LDM)</h2>
            <p>
              Targeting the Lymphatic System—which supports our body’s immune
              function—Lymphatic Drainage Massage uses gentle pressure and a
              specific sequence to encourage better function in filtering
              foreign contaminants. Unlike the blood which gets pumped through
              the body by the contractions of the heart, the lymph fluid does
              not have a pump, and thus flows more easily when stimulated by
              body movement and LDM. Clients who are recovering from surgery, or
              suffer with allergies, edema (swelling), and auto-immune diseases
              can benefit greatly from this modality.

            <h2>TMJ</h2>
            <p>
              The temporomandibular joint, often referred to as TMJ, is the
              joint that connects your mandible (lower jaw) to your skull.
              Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD) can be extremely painful,
              cause headaches and neck pain. Incorporating TMJ massage into a
              session can help loosen the muscles around the joint to help
              relieve pain and tension. This can sometimes include intra-oral
              massage to help release the masseter, one of the major muscles
              that can contribute to TMJD. (Licensed Massage Therapist will wear
              gloves and a form must be signed giving LMT permission to do
              intra-oral massage)

            <h2>Reiki</h2>
            <p>
              Reiki is a Japanese form of energy healing that is a hands on way
              for a practitioner to promote inner and physical well being in a
              client. When the 7 chakras of the body (Crown, Brow, Throat,
              Heart, Solarplexus, Sacral and Root) are working optimally, the
              benefits can be felt physically and mentally. Reiki can be used to
              help with depression, anxiety, nausea and physical pain. A typical
              session can last from 30-90 minutes, and is a very still and
              relaxing experience. The practitioner will lay their palms on the
              body and using Universal energy can channel inter healing to the
              areas of the body in need.

            <h2>Craniosacral Therapy</h2>
            <p>
              This modality uses light pressure to help move the cerebral spinal
              fluid (CSF) that is in and around our central nervous system. When
              cerebral spinal fluid becomes stagnate or blocked it can sometimes
              cause pain chronic or sudden onset, headaches, TMJ, and these are
              just a few issues that can occur when our cerebral spinal fluid is
              not moving as it should. Craniosacral Therapy helps bring balance
              back and can be thought of as a Swedish Massage for your central
              nervous system. The affects of Craniosacral Therapy can take up to
              48 hours to take full effect and can last for up to 2 weeks.
